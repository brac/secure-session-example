# Simple Session Encryption

## Overview

Encrypt and decrypt the session cookie with `cryptr` or another ecryption tool of your choice. If you want the encrypted cookies to be usable after you terminate and restart the application, choose a method that you consider secure enough for using a persistently stored encryption key, and document in the `README.md` file whatever the person installing the application needs to do to choose and persistently store a key.
